# Spotify-Web-APP

A Spotify Web App built using React and the Spotify Web API

There should be an auth-server folder in the directory but it is refusing to upload to GitHub, download it from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LltQw_1A_j22EH1-8kyME2u2gE9UR8XA

In order to get this project working, clone it and add the auth-server folder to the project directory.
 
  Open up a command terminal and navigate to the project directory then to auth-server.
  Type "node authorization_code/app.js" and run the command.
  In another terminal navigate to the project directory.
  Type "npm start".
  Go to "localhost:3000" in your browser and sign into your Spotify account.
  Playback controls are only available on premium accounts.
